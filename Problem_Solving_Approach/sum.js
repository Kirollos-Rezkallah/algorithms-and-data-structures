// ==================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
// ==================================================

// Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// Implement addition

// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// It seems easy but it is not, it depends, are we talking about integers? floating? ...what is the size of the number?
//Also are we only work with 2 inputs? What if we have only one?
// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
